# Fashion E-commerce
A template for online shopping consist of clothes as the product.

I watch a few videos of how to make a full template website using html, css and javascript and this what I came up with. It helps me to understand the fundamentals of creating a commercial website, even if it is not fully functional it gives me the ability to design and understand the basic structure of html and css.

* Languanges: html, css, javascript
* Icons: Font Awesome https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css
* Font: Google font - Poppins
* Images: svg, png, jpg, and webp

Reminder:
* I do not owe any of the images and it was for personal and educational purposes only.
